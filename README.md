### Project 1: Predict Sales for a Catalog Launch
#### Context
* A home-goods manufacturer wants to predict expected profits from a catalog launch. I applied a
framework to work through the problem and build a linear regression model to provide results and a recommendation.

### Project 2: Create an Analytical Dataset
#### Context
* A pet store chain is selecting the location for its next store. I used data preparation techniques to build
a robust analytic dataset and used it to build a predictive model to select the best location.

### Project 3: Predict Loan Default Risk
#### Context
* A bank recently received an influx of loan applications. I built and applied a classification model to
provide a recommendation on which loan applicants the bank should lend to.

### Project 4: A/B Test a New Menu Launch
#### Context
* A chain of coffee shops is considering launching a new menu. I designed and analyzed an A/B test and
write up a recommendation on whether the chain should introduce the new menu.

### Project 5: Retail Chain Expansion
#### Task 1: Determining Store Format
* Client currently has 85 grocery stores and is planning to open 10 new stores at the beginning of the year. Currently, all stores use the same store format for selling their products. Up until now, the company has treated all stores similarly, shipping the same amount of product to each store. This is beginning to cause problems as stores are suffering from product surpluses in some product categories and shortages in others. I've been asked to provide analytical support to make decisions about store formats and inventory planning.

#### Task 2: Store Format for New Stores
* The grocery store chain has 10 new stores opening up at the beginning of the year. Client wants to determine which store format each of the new stores should have. However, I don’t have sales data for these new stores yet, so I have to determine the format using each of the new store’s demographic data.

#### Task 3: Forecasting
* Fresh produce has a short life span, and due to increasing costs, Client wants to have an accurate monthly sales forecast.
