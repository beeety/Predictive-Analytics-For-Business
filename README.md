Apply predictive analytics and business intelligence to solve real-world business problems in the following projects

### Project: Predict Sales for a Catalog Launch
#### Context
A home-goods manufacturer wants to predict expected profits from a catalog launch. You will apply a
framework to work through the problem and build a linear regression model to provide results and a
recommendation
#### Predictive Techniques
Linear Regression, Porblem Solving Framework

### Project: Create an Analytical Dataset
#### Context
A pet store chain is selecting the location for its next store. You will use data preparation techniques to build
a robust analytic dataset and use it to build a predictive model to select the best location.
#### Predictive Techniques
Data Wrangling

### Project: Predict Loan Default Risk
#### Context
A bank recently received an influx of loan applications. You will build and apply a classification model to
provide a recommendation on which loan applicants the bank should lend to.
#### Predictive Techniques
Classification Models

### Project: A/B Test a New Menu Launch

### Project: Retail Chain Expansion
#### Context
Task 1: Determining Store Format

To remedy the product surplus and shortages, the company wants to introduce different store formats. Each store format will have a different product selection in order to better match local demand. The actual building sizes will not change, just the product selection and internal layouts. The terms "formats" and "segments" will be used interchangeably throughout this project. 

Task 2: Store Format for New Stores

The grocery store chain has 10 new stores opening up at the beginning of the year. The company wants to determine which store format each of the new stores should have. However, we don’t have sales data for these new stores yet, so we’ll have to determine the format using each of the new store’s demographic data.

Task 3: Forecasting

Fresh produce has a short life span, and due to increasing costs, the company wants to have an accurate monthly sales forecast.

#### Predictive Techniques
Segmentation and Clustering, Time Series Forecasting, Classification Model
